# Web3CLI Web Interface

This directory will contain the future web interface for Web3CLI, providing a GUI alternative to the command-line tool.

## Planned Features

- Contract generation through a user-friendly web form
- Visualization of the agent collaboration process
- Real-time contract validation and security feedback
- Interactive code editor with syntax highlighting
- Template gallery for common contract patterns
- User authentication and saved contract history
- Documentation and tutorials integrated in the interface

## Technical Stack

The web interface will be built using:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (or Next.js with API routes)
- **Authentication**: OAuth integration
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for easy deployment

## Development Status

This feature is planned for a future release. See the [future-enhancements.md](/docs/future-enhancements.md) document for more details on the roadmap.
