# Web3CLI Design Document

## Design Tradeoffs

### Model Choice: OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Pros**: Superior understanding of Solidity code patterns, security vulnerabilities, and blockchain concepts
- **Cons**: API cost, reliance on external service
- **Rationale**: For security-critical code generation, the improved accuracy and security awareness of GPT-4o justifies the cost

### CLI vs. Web Interface
- **Pros of CLI**: Lightweight, integrates with developer workflows, easy to script/automate
- **Cons**: Limited UI capabilities, less intuitive for non-technical users
- **Rationale**: Target audience is developers who are comfortable with command-line tools

### Security vs. Speed
- Prioritized security by:
  - Using vector database to provide security patterns and best practices
  - Including specific security prompts in system messages
  - Adding security considerations to generated output
  - Using the most capable model (GPT-4o) for critical code generation

## Scaling Considerations

### Caching
- **Contract Templates**: Cache commonly requested contract types (ERC20, ERC721, etc.)
- **Documentation Chunks**: Store pre-processed documentation chunks for faster retrieval
- **Contract Analysis**: Cache analysis results for popular contracts

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel Processing**: Use worker threads for vector search and contract analysis
- **Tiered Model Selection**: Use cheaper models for initial drafts, premium models for final verification
- **Selective Embedding**: Only embed relevant documentation sections to reduce vector DB size

### Infrastructure
- **Distributed Vector Database**: Move from local JSONL files to a distributed vector database like Pinecone
- **API Gateway**: Create a service layer to handle rate limiting and caching
- **Containerization**: Package the tool as a Docker container for consistent deployment

## Risks of LLM-Generated Code in Blockchain Contexts

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: LLMs may generate code with subtle security flaws not apparent to users
- **Mitigation**: Include explicit security considerations with each generated contract and recommend security audits

### Outdated Patterns
- **Risk**: LLMs trained on older code may use deprecated or insecure patterns
- **Mitigation**: Keep documentation vector database updated with latest best practices

### Hallucinated Features
- **Risk**: LLMs might "hallucinate" non-existent Solidity features or EIPs
- **Mitigation**: Validate generated code against known standards and compiler versions

### Over-reliance
- **Risk**: Developers may over-trust LLM-generated code without proper review
- **Mitigation**: Clear warnings that generated code should be reviewed by security professionals

### Gas Optimization
- **Risk**: Generated code may not be gas-efficient
- **Mitigation**: Include gas optimization considerations in the prompt

## Implementation Details

### Vector Database for Documentation
- Uses OpenAI embeddings to create searchable documentation
- Stores Solidity, Ethers.js, and Hardhat documentation
- Provides relevant context for code generation and explanation

### Smart Contract Generation
- Structured prompting with security-first principles
- Output includes both code and security considerations
- Option to generate test files for verification

### Smart Contract Explanation
- Uses ethers.js to fetch contract code and ABI
- Extracts relevant features for targeted documentation search
- Provides structured analysis of security patterns and permissions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Gas Estimation**: Add automated gas cost estimation for generated contracts
2. **Security Scoring**: Implement a security score based on known patterns and vulnerabilities
3. **Custom Documentation**: Allow users to add their own documentation to the vector database
4. **Contract Verification**: Integrate with block explorers for automatic contract verification
5. **Formal Verification Integration**: Connect with formal verification tools for critical contracts
